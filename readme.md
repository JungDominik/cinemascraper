## Description
The Berlin cinema scraper displays the currently running films and their showtimes by scraping the website of the local Berlin cinema.
It answers the questions / usecases
* Which films are on show at the moment?
* What are the next sessions for my chosen film and in which cinema?


## Technical Implementation
Cinemascraper utilizes webscraping package BeautifulSoup for its ease of application and pandas as a solution for managing showtimes data.

## Future Development plans
In the long run, the goal is to implement the tool as a command line interface application for the terminal

## How to install
